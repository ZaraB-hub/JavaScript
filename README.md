This repository is for my personal project to improve my knowledge and skills in Javascript by completing exercises from the website https://javascript30.com/. The website offers a 30 day challenge where you can build 30 things in 30 days with vanilla javascript. I will be going through the course and completing each exercise as a way to challenge myself and deepen my understanding of the language.

The goal of this project is to become more proficient in Javascript and to have a better understanding of the language.
